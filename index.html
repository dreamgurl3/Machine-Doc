            <h2 id="washing-method">Washing Method</h2>
            <p>To start the process of washing : You want to turn on the faucet to fill the tub with water.Itâ€™s a good
                idea to put detergent in the tub as you fill the tub with water to let the powder dissolve. Fill the
                water to a desire level, then you can put your clothes into the tub. If you need to add a bit more water
                into the tub, you can. Once your clothes are in, simply turn the washing time to desire minutes.
                Typically, 12 minutes is sufficient enough.

                to
                the spin tub after getting the soap off the clothes.
